# MONKEY INTERPRETER IN GOLANG

This is my implementation of the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by THORSTEN BALL where he builds a simple interpreter for language he calls the Monkey programming language.

I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about interpreters and wants to learn how they work.

He has also written [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/) which I might do after finishing this.
